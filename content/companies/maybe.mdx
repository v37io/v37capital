Maybe, founded in 2021 by Josh Pigford and Travis Woods, is a financial planning and investment management platform designed to provide an overall view of individual finances.

At its core, Maybe operates as a financial planner and wealth management tool. The platform is built with the goal of helping users make informed financial decisions by providing a comprehensive overview of their financial situation.

Maybe differentiates itself by offering a range of features that empower users to visualize and plan for their financial future. Users can run simulations to visualize different milestones like reaching financial independence, starting a business, or buying a first home.
The platform also allows users to see where they'll be financially years from now and provides the probability of reaching their goals.

For any financial inquiries, users have the opportunity to ask a real advisor on their own time and get their questions answered by qualified professionals, simplifying the process and making financial planning more accessible.
