[Zipline International Inc.](https://flyzipline.com), founded in March 2014, has been at the forefront of drone delivery innovation.
Based in South San Francisco, California, Zipline designs, manufactures, and operates delivery drones that have made more than 600.000

Zipline's drone delivery service was born out of a pivot from the founders' previous venture, Romotive, which was centered around an iPhone-controlled robotic toy.
In 2014, the team decided to shut down Romotive and explore a more impactful mission, leading to the creation of Zipline.

The company's drones are primarily known for delivering medical products, including whole blood, platelets, frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate, as well as vaccines, infusions, and common medical commodities.
In fact, as of September 2021, more than 75% of blood deliveries in Rwanda outside of Kigali were made using Zipline drones. The company expanded its operations to Ghana in April 2019, where it began using drones to deliver vaccines, blood, and medicines.

Zipline's groundbreaking work has not gone unnoticed. The company was named to CNBC's Disruptor 50 list in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022, and 2023, ranking as high as 7th place in 2020. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also selected Zipline to participate in a type certification program for delivery drones in 2020.

But Zipline's impact extends beyond medical deliveries. The company also offers delivery services for non-medical products, partnering with companies like Walmart and Sweetgreen to provide services for restaurants, groceries, convenience shopping, and e-commerce.

As Zipline continues to innovate and expand, its potential seems limitless. The company raised $190 million in May 2019, reaching a post-money valuation of $1.2 billion, and it has continued to grow since then.
